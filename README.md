# InsureSafe

## Summary

- An app that would help users keep track of personal property items for an insurance claim


## technologies

- MEAN Stack
 - Express
 - Angular
 - Unsure about database at this point - will need to frame out if it makes more sense to use MongoDB or PSQL
 - Node.js
- Gulp
- Mocha/Chai testing
- Bootstrap

### APIs

- Sendgrid - for sending email reminders
- (Maybe Twilio also)


## MVP

- Users will be able to login (with an email and password OR through Google)
- Users will be able to create a directory of personal property for insurance documentation - would include brand, serial numbers, cost, date of purchase, and uploads of photos or receipts if they have them
- Users would be emailed on key dates (holidays, birthday) to prompt for updating
- Users could log in and delete or update their items


## Additional features

- User-friendly and responsive UI
- Email reminders to user for updating their info

## Stretch Goals

- Users could print a PDF of their items
- Users could search for item cost using Amazon API if I can figure out how to use that...
- Users would be able to select items by room and be given a general cost of replacement (ie - I have a couch and a dining table and two armchairs and a television - total replacement cost could be in $x-$y range)
